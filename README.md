# Getting started

### MarketStack API setup

After installing `tstock`, you will need a MarketStack API key to pull the market data.

- Make a free MarketStack API account at https://marketstack.com/signup/free
- Login and find your API Access Key on the Dashboard page
- Run `export MARKETSTACK_API_KEY=<your access key>`. You can make this permanent by adding that command to your `.bashrc`.

### Usage

Run `./tstock TICKER` to get the 3 month chart of `$TICKER`. Use `-d DAYS` to specify the number of days back you want to pull. Use `-y LINES` to specify the length of the chart's y axis.

You can get indexes by appending `.INDX`. for example, `./tstock DJI.INDX` to get the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Find more information on how to specify special tickers on MarketWatch's API Docs: https://marketstack.com/documentation
